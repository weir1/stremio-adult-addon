feat: Improve performance, reliability, and features

This commit addresses several key issues to improve the addon's performance, reliability, and user experience.

- **Performance: Faster Search Results**
  - Refactored catalog handling to defer poster generation until an item is selected. This makes search results appear significantly faster by avoiding multiple API calls to ThePornDB during the initial search.

- **Reliability: Robust Multi-File & FansDB Handling**
  - Fixed a critical bug where torrents with multiple video files were not being listed correctly. The stream handler now properly parses all torrent types and creates individual streams for each video file.
  - Resolved an API error with the FansDB integration by updating the GraphQL query to use the correct field names (`posters` instead of `images`).

- **Features: Enhanced User Experience**
  - The addon now displays the number of video files contained in a torrent in the item's metadata description.
  - Added a descriptive note to P2P streams, informing users that they can increase the cache size in Stremio's settings for smoother playback.
  - Improved the TorBox error handling for when the active download limit is reached.
